# Development setup

To develop/run this service you will need Jaeger and rabbitmq, like in this example docker-compose file.

```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  rabbitmq:
    container_name: mailer-rabbitmq
    image: rabbitmq:3.10.1-management
    ports:
      - 5672:5672
      - 15672:15672

  jaeger:
    container_name: mailer-jaeger
    image: "jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest"
    ports:
      - "5775:5775/udp"
      - "6831:6831/udp"
      - "6832:6832/udp"
      - "5778:5778"
      - "16686:16686"
      - "14268:14268"
      - "9411:9411"
```

## SES setup

First create a SES identity to use as the default email sender address

![sender](./imgs/create-sender.png "sender")

after verifying the identity email address, you can use it as the default sender
by setting the `APP_DEFAULT_EMAIL_SENDER` env var

Now we need to create a configuration set to track email events using SNS and SES, following steps:

- create a SES configuration set
- create a SNS event topic with the standard type
- on your SES configuration set, add a event destination to the created SNS topic
- create a HTTPS subscription pointing to the URL of where you pretend to host this service
- finally run this service with the env var `AWS_SES_TRACKING_CONFIG_SET` set to the name of the cfg set you created


## Routing SNS events to your local machine

When developing, its handy to route SNS requests directly to your machine, to do this you need to give it
a public url/ip, one easy way is using [NGROK](https://ngrok.com/). after installing just run

```sh
ngrok http 3005
```

now create a SNS subscription pointing to the generated url + /ses-events, eg:

![subscription](./imgs/create-subscription.png "subscription")

after sending a confirmation request, the link will be printed to stdout

```sh
[WEB] SNS subscription confirmation link: https://sns.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/?Action=ConfirmSubscription&TopicArn=arn:aws:sns:...&Token=...
```

Just click the link to activate the subscription. Now every email with `"enableTracking": true` should publish its events to SNS, which
will publish the events to the HTTPS endpoint to your PC.
